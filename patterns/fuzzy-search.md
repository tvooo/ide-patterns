# Fuzzy Search & Fuzzy Matching

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_search):

> In computer science, approximate string matching (often colloquially referred to as fuzzy string searching) is the technique of finding strings that match a pattern approximately (rather than exactly).

Fuzzy search can be applied to basically every search within an IDE, and is usually applied *live*.

## Examples

Sublime Text implements fuzzy search for its Command Palette, its Symbol Search as well as for its File Search.

The **Emmet** plugin for Sublime Text allows you to construct CSS rules "fuzzily". For example, ```tac''' gets expanded to ```text-align: center'''.
