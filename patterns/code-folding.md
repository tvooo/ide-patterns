# Code Folding

## Examples

Eclipse exposes code folding through arrows in the code editor's left gutter, next to line numbers and breakpoints.

Vim supports code folding in a variety of ways. Usually, it shows the number of lines folded away, and also persists the folding state on quit, so that it is available the next time the file is opened.
